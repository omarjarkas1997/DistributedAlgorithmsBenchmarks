Benchmarks 2017
=========================

This directory contains synthesis benchmarks that were presented at
[OPODIS'17](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8635/pdf/LIPIcs-OPODIS-2017-32.pdf).
Note that we are using exclusively threshold automata in this paper instead
of Promela code. A description of the benchmarks is given in the paper.

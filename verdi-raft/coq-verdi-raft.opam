synopsis: "Verified implementation of the Raft distributed consensus protocol in Coq"
description: """
Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand
and is equivalent to Paxos in fault tolerance and performance. Verdi Raft is a
verified implementation of Raft in Coq, constructed using the Verdi framework.
Included is a verified fault-tolerant key-value store using Raft.
